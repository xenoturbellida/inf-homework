Chat room scripts are inside `tsockets` folder.

Clone the repo. Open `server.py` in a console at first, then `client.py` in another console window. You are free to add as many clients as you want.
When your roommate leaves a chat (closes the terminal), you connect to another chat room. If there is not an available chat room for now, you will be waiting for next conversation.
